# Software Rpositories

 Going into _/etc/yum.repos.d/_ you can find many CentOS repositories.

 Repo files are stored in the _/etc/repo_ directory.

 Use `update` to update them all. Can also use `yum search [package]` to check something specific.

 To know which packages are installed use `rpm -qa` to query all packages on the system.
