# Linux System Administration Full Course

Hi! Based on the amazing full course provided by **Geek's Lesson** that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsh64rjnRas&t=19618s) I have generated some notes!

## Notes Structure
The note files are divided into 2 directories:
1. Client - for Linux client admin sections, and
2. Server - for Linux server admin sections of the video.

There is a markdown file containing notes for each section of the video:
- Client
    - Linux Installation Overview
    - Command Line Navigation
    - File Systems
    - People and Permissions
    - Software Repositories
    - Programs and Scripts
    - Services and Firewalls
    - Processes and Resources
    - Kernel and Hardware
    - Logs and Queues
- Server
    - Linux Installation Overview
    - Network File System (NFS) Overview
    - Samba Overview
    - Apache Web Server Overview
    - Database Server Overview
    - Secure Shell Server Overview
    - Mail Servers (Postfix) Overview
    - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Overview
    - Domain Name System (DNS) Overview
    - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 

## Notes info
- You might find abreviations such as: 
    - _CL_ this would stand as Command Line
    - _OS_ this would stand for Operating System
    - _cd_ it's a command but in the notes also stands for change directory
- Any time in a piece of code `like this` you find `[something]` it's just to signal that the _something_ is to go in that line of code and **without** the '[ ]'.
- Any time in a piece of code `like this` you see `#` it indicates a number goes there. When it has more than one '#' it may indicate the number of digits that number has.

## Disclaimer
1. The notes were written for my own understanding. Later on I decided to share them. This means you might find points where not all information is captured (I captured information that was new to me, so those areas I knew more about I wrote less (Software Repositories and Programs and Scripts)). Sorry if this causes any inconvenience. 
2. Notes were written on the go - you will find syntax issues and probably misspelled words or sentances might by grammatically strange. I apologise in advance :D I will try to fix any issues that are pinpointed out.
